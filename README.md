# AIvalytics Project - Feature Implementation Status

## Content Creation & MCQ Generation

- **Feature: Teachers submit educational content via WhatsApp.**
  - **Status:** Not implemented. No WhatsApp integration is present in the codebase.

- **Feature: Backend Server routes content to the AI/ML Engine.**
  - **Status:** Partially implemented. The `route.js` file uses the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` to generate MCQs based on a topic and difficulty.

- **Feature: AI/ML Engine generates unique MCQs.**
  - **Status:** Implemented. The POST endpoint in `route.js` generates MCQs and ensures valid JSON format.

- **Feature: Generated MCQs are stored in the Unique MCQ Database.**
  - **Status:** Not implemented. There is no database logic to store generated MCQs.

## Student Assessment Process

- **Feature: Unique MCQ sets are distributed to students via WhatsApp.**
  - **Status:** Not implemented. No WhatsApp integration exists.

- **Feature: Students complete MCQ tests in WhatsApp.**
  - **Status:** Not implemented. The current implementation uses a web-based interface for test creation and preview (`/createTest/page.jsx`).

- **Feature: Completed tests are submitted back through WhatsApp.**
  - **Status:** Not implemented. No WhatsApp submission logic is present.

- **Feature: Secure submission and tracking of student responses.**
  - **Status:** Partially implemented. The `StudentResponse` model in `studentResponseModel.ts` can store responses, but no submission logic is implemented.

## Performance Analysis & Reporting

- **Feature: Backend Server processes submissions and routes them to the AI/ML Analytics Engine.**
  - **Status:** Not implemented. No analytics engine integration exists.

- **Feature: AI identifies knowledge gaps, learning patterns, and areas requiring attention.**
  - **Status:** Not implemented. No logic for performance analysis is present.

- **Feature: Personalized reports with actionable insights.**
  - **Status:** Not implemented. No report generation logic exists.

## Feedback & Improvement Loop

- **Feature: Reports are delivered to teachers and parents via WhatsApp.**
  - **Status:** Not implemented. No WhatsApp integration exists.

- **Feature: AI provides improvement suggestions.**
  - **Status:** Not implemented. No logic for generating improvement suggestions exists.

- **Feature: Teachers provide feedback to improve future assessments.**
  - **Status:** Not implemented. No feedback mechanism is present.

## Data Integration

- **Feature: Comprehensive record of content, questions, responses, and reports.**
  - **Status:** Partially implemented. Models like `Mcq_tests`, `StudentResponse`, and `Teacher` exist, but no logic ties them together comprehensively.
